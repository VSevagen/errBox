#1st solution
requirements.txt ---> django dependency missing, add Django==2.2
                 ---> django rest framework missing, djangorestframework==3.11.1

#2nd solution
serializers.py ---> The `fields` option must be a list or tuple or "__all__". Got str, add comma to make single element tuple
               ---> Missing artists attribute, add "artist" to fields
#3
template not loading
load static missing

#4
Migrations not working
C caps instead of small

#4
Add redirect in place of render in task request

#5
migrartations will not work as the app is not listed in installed apps
#6
url regex wrong
correct
url(r'^token/$', views.token, name='get_token'),
url(r'^/$', views.tasks, name='tasks'),
url(r'^songs/$', views.ListSongsView.as_view(), name="songs-all")
#7 in views task
has to send a tuple instead of a get_random_string
